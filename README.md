## 📄 Technical Approach

This application demonstrates modern web development best practices with a focus on accessibility and user experience. The voice recognition system uses the browser's native Speech Recognition API for privacy and performance, while the NLP layer provides intelligent command parsing without requiring external services.

The component architecture follows React best practices with proper separation of concerns, making the codebase maintainable and scalable. The design system uses Tailwind CSS for consistent, responsive layouts with subtle animations and micro-interactions that enhance user engagement.

Smart suggestions are generated using a combination of usage patterns, seasonal context, and product relationships, providing a personalized shopping experience that improves over time.
